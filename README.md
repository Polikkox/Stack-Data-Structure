****Assignment: Stack****

**Implement a queue. Requirements:**
    
    New items are being added at the end of a queue using e nqueue() method. Peak() method can be used to check/ look at the first      element and dequeue() method is used to proceed first element (and get that element out of queue).
    
   1)  Don't use any collection inside that queue, a Node class should be used instead:
    
    Three methods should be implemented:
    public void enqueue (String value);
    public String peek();
    public String dequeue();

   2) Add two new methods to our CustomQueue class:

    public int queueSize();
    public bool isEmpty();

as well as error handling in situation when a queue is empty and a user tries to dequeue() or peak()
